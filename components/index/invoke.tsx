### Before you get started
- Executing atomic tests may leave your system in an undesirable state. You are responsible for understanding what a test does before executing.
- Ensure you have permission to test before you begin.
- It is recommended to set up a test machine for atomic test execution that is similar to the build in your environment. Be sure you have your collection/EDR solution in place, and that the endpoint is checking in and active.

Invoke-AtomicRedTeam installation and usage instructions can be found on the docs on the top menu.

There are a series of short instructional videos on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL92eUXSF717W9TCfZzLca6DmlFXFIu8p6).

You can also find an in-depth 1 hour webcast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6w0oFcCAnI), with hands-on lab documents [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AvDXyd4cgfxesEclTt8tScoatJn2?e=pb0tsR).
