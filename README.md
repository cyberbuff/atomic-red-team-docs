# Atomic Red Team Docs

Welcome to the new Atomic Red Team wiki. This wiki is a work in progress. If you have any questions, please reach out to
us on the [Slack channel](https://slack.atomicredteam.io/).

This website uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site) and [Elastic UI](https://eui.elastic.co).

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
