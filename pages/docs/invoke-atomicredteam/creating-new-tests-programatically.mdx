The `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam` module contains several `New-Atomic*` functions to facilitate using native PowerShell to create and validate atomic techniques and tests. These functions were written to address the following:

* Atomic tests previously needed to be written by hand which is perfectly acceptable in many cases but can be error-prone.
* Previously, when writing atomic tests, there was no way to validate the YAML against a schema aside from executing [`validate-atomics.rb`](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/bin/validate-atomics.rb) in the `atomic-red-team` repository.
* Previously, there was no way to build techniques/tests in an automated fashion using code. Imagine a scenario where hundreds of tests needed to be generated on the fly. Writing that many tests by hand is just not feasible.

The `New-Atomic*` functions output a well-formatted PowerShell object that is designed to be piped directly to `ConvertTo-Yaml` when you're ready to save your technique/tests in YAML format. You'll never have to write YAML again for atomics if you don't want to.

The following functions are available to help build atomic techniques and tests:

### `New-AtomicTechnique`

Specifies a new atomic red team technique. The output of this function is designed to be piped directly to ConvertTo-Yaml, eliminating the need to work with YAML directly.

### `New-AtomicTest`

Specifies the name of the test that indicates how it tests the technique.

### `New-AtomicTestDependency`

Specifies a new dependency that must be met prior to execution of an atomic test.

### `New-AtomicTestInputArgument`

Specifies an input to an atomic test that is a requirement to run the test (think of these like function arguments).
