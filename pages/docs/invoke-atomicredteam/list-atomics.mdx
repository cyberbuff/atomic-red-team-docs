Now that the execution framework is [installed](/invoke-atomicredteam/getting-started) and the module is [imported](/invoke-atomicredteam/import-module) you are ready to start using it. A good starting point is to list the Technique numbers and test names available for execution.

## Show Details Brief

Use the `-ShowDetailsBrief` switch to list the tests available for a given technique number.

```powershell
# List atomic tests that can be run from the current platform (Windows,Linux,macOS)
Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -ShowDetailsBrief
```

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
  You can pass <b>-anyOS</b> to show details of the atomic regardless of which platform it can be executed from.
</Callout>

```powershell
# List all atomic tests regardless of which platform it can be executed from
Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -ShowDetailsBrief -anyOS
```

If you would like to show details for all techniques, you can use "All" as the technique number.

```powershell
# List atomic tests that can be run from the current platform (Windows,Linux,macOS)
Invoke-AtomicTest All -ShowDetailsBrief
```

Showing the brief details is an easy way to identify the atomic test number associated with each test, which can then be used to specify individual tests to execute.

## Show Details (verbose)

Use the `-ShowDetails` switch to show test details, including attack commands, input parameters, and prerequisites for a given technique number.

```powershell
# List atomic tests that can be run from the current platform (Windows,Linux,macOS)
Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 -ShowDetails
```
