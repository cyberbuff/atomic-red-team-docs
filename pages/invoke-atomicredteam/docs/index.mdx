  PowerShell Core on
  Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6)

    The Invoke-AtomicRedTeam Execution is available for install from the PowerShell Gallery and can be installed with
    one simple command executed from a PowerShell prompt:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name invoke-atomicredteam,powershell-yaml -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    <Callout>
      If you get an error relating to a missing PSRepository, use the following command to register the needed
      repository.
    </Callout>

    ```powershell
    Register-PSRepository -Default
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    continue with the following instructions:
    ```powershell
    IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1'
