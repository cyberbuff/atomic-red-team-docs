## Features
Windows Sandbox is a lightweight, isolated environment that allows you to run untrusted applications for Windows users. When you run ART in Windows Sandbox, you can ensure that any "malicious-like" activities or artifacts generated by the tests won't affect your host system. Once you close the Sandbox, all changes are discarded.

Setting up Windows Sandbox is relatively easy, as it's a built-in feature in Windows 10 and later versions. You don't need to install additional software or configure complex settings. You can quickly launch ART in a clean environment for testing purposes.

## Requirements
You can check [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview#windows-edition-and-licensing-requirements) for Windows editions that support Sandbox.

## Installation
Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview#installation) to enable Windows Sandbox in your machine.

## Usage
Once you enable Windows Sandbox, download and open the [WSB file](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/blob/master/sandbox/art.wsb) from your File Explorer. It should launch a clean environment for running your atomics.
