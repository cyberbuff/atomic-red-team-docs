Atomic Red Teamâ„¢ is a library of simple tests that every security team can
execute to test their controls. Tests are focused, have few dependencies, and
are defined in a structured format that can be used by automation frameworks.

You can see a variety of atomic tests in action in
the [Atomic Spotlight series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-4fuTjKox5en_SOd0teFlsk9co4StXnW) on YouTube.

## Prepare your environment

Before you start testing, you'll need the following:

- **Permission to test.** Always ask your environment owner for permission
  before executing an atomic test.
- **A test machine.** Set up a machine that mimics the build of your
  environment. Make sure your security solution is active.

## Choose a test

We store all of our atomic test files in the `atomics` directory of the Atomic
Red Teamâ„¢ repository. To keep things organized, we divide tests into directories
named after the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® technique they represent. For example, we keep
[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) tests in
`atomic-red-team/atomics/T1055/`.

Each technique directory contains the following:

- A YAML test file
- A human-readable Markdown test file
- An optional `src` directory for source file dependencies
- An optional `bin` directory for binary dependencies

Browse the `atomics` directory for an appropriate test. You can also select
a test from one of these lists:

- [All atomic tests](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/Indexes/Indexes-Markdown/index.md)
- [Tests for Linux](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/Indexes/Indexes-Markdown/linux-index.md)
- [Tests for macOS](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/Indexes/Indexes-Markdown/macos-index.md)
- [Tests for Windows](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/Indexes/Indexes-Markdown/windows-index.md)

## Run your test

Open the Markdown test definition file and navigate to your test of choice. You can either run the test manually (copy
and paste commands) or automated using an Execution Framework.
This [Getting Started with Atomic Red Team](https://youtu.be/eHZEyEf_icE?t=1840) webcast recording will get you up and
running with the most popular execution framework
called [Invoke-AtomicRedTeam](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/wiki).

### Install dependencies

Some tests have a "Dependencies" subheading. These tests require additional
files to run. To install dependencies, execute the commands in the "Get Prereq
Commands" subheading.

### Run the test

To run your test, execute the commands in the "Attack Commands" subheading. Note
what information, if any, is collected by your security solution.

### Clean your environment

Some tests make changes to your environment. To revert these changes,
run the commands in the "Cleanup Commands" subheading.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Be sure to replace any `#{<input>}` arguments with the inputs
specified by the "Inputs" heading of the Markdown test file.

## Next steps

- Use the data collected by your security solution to evaluate and improve your
  detection coverage.
- Automatically run atomic tests using an execution framework like
  [Invoke-Atomic](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam).
